# infchest
Introduces a configurable node, the Infinite Chest, that replicates indefinitely whatever item is put into it.

Only players with the 'infchest' priv can configure the chest.

The slot to the left configures what item is to be replicated (only modifyable with 'infchest' priv), and the items in the slots to the right can be taken by anyone.

TODO: 
Preserve replicated items metadata.
Add global interval configuration using commands.
Add per-chest local interval configuration using the formspec.
