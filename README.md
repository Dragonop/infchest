# infchest
Introduces a configurable node, the Infinite Chest, that replicates indefinitely whatever item is put into it. On a configurable (WIP) interval.
Only players with 'give' privs can set up the chest.
Then slot to the left decides what item is to be replicated (only modifyable with 'give' priv), and the slots on the right can be taken by anyone.

TODO: 
Preserve replicated items metadata.
Add global interval configuration using commands.
Add per-chest local interval configuration using the formspec.
Change of scope/fork: Revamp the mod to be a "photocopier" of sorts.
